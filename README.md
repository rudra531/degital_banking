"#Digital Banking"
-------------------
The Digital Banking System  is an online platform designed to facilitate secure 
banking services for both users and administrators. Built using Spring Boot, 
JSP, and MySQL, the system allows users to apply for a savings or current 
account, with an auto-generated account number provided during the 
application process. After admin approval, users can log in to their accounts 
and access key functionalities such as viewing their account balance, 
depositing money, adding beneficiaries, transferring funds, and reviewing 
transaction history. Administrators play a crucial role by approving user 
registrations, managing user details, and adding or updating frequently asked 
questions (FAQs) to assist users. The system ensures secure login and data 
transmission using Spring Security, providing a reliable and secure 
environment for managing banking activities. With its comprehensive 
features and user-friendly interface, the Digital Banking System offers an 
efficient solution for modern online banking needs.
